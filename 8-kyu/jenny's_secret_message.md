## Jenny's secret message

Jenny has written a function that returns a greeting for a user. However, she's in love with Johnny, and would like to greet him slightly different. She added a special case to her function, but she made a mistake.

Can you help her?

### Example:

```python
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, {name}!".format(name=name)
    if name == "Johnny":
        return "Hello, my love!"
```

---

### Solution

```python
def greet(name):
    if name == "Johnny":
        return "Hello, my love!"
    else:
        return f"Hello, {name}!"
```
