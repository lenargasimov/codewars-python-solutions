## Opposites Attract

Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.

Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.

### Solution

```python
def lovefunc( flower1, flower2 ):
    if flower1 % 2 == 0 and flower2 % 2 != 0 or flower1 % 2 != 0 and flower2 % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else: 
        return False
```
